  <h2 class="date">1898</h2>
  
  <p>
    On June 13, 1898, Prince Edward School's humble origins unfolded through the efforts of visionary and daring citizens, unaware at the time that this tiny "acorn" would sprout into a majestic "oak." A committee, seeking to establish a suitable school building to accommodate 75 pupils, a Master, and necessary facilities, bestowed the name 'Salisbury Public Undenominational School' upon its precursor. They invited local architects to submit plans, with Mr A C A Cator eventually commissioned to design a structure not to exceed £1,000 in cost (though it amounted to £2,000 in the end). The building comprised a single classroom, two small rooms, and a verandah for the Headmaster. Prior to this, the British South Africa Company granted the committee four acres of land on Moffat Street. The Superintendent of Education in the Cape Colony appointed the Headmaster, Mr John Kerr, and the first teacher, Mrs Garcia from South Africa, with salaries of £180 and £90 per annum respectively. Remarkably, Mrs Garcia arrived by coach from Bulawayo since the railway had not yet reached Salisbury. On November 14, 1898, in the middle of the term, Salisbury Public Undenominational School welcomed its first intake, consisting of two boys and two girls, including notable names such as Vivian and Frank Pascoe.</p>

  <h2 class="date">1989-1923</h2>
  
  <p>1899 witnessed the enrollment of twenty-one pupils, each paying 10 shillings a month.

    In 1900, the number of enrolled pupils increased to 27. Unfortunately, frequent disputes between Mr. Kerr and Mrs. Garcia, along with financial issues between the Government and Municipality, clouded the school's future.
    
    By 1901, the Government assumed control of the school, renaming it 'Salisbury Public School.'
    
    In 1902, under the guidance of the newly appointed Headmaster Mr. H. Duthie, the school welcomed 39 enrolled pupils.
    
    In 1903, Mr. D. Blue took on the role of Headmaster.
    
    In 1906, the school underwent another name change, becoming 'Salisbury High School.'
    
    By 1908, with an enrollment of 52 pupils, the girls relocated, leading to the adoption of the name 'Salisbury Boys' High School.'
    
    In 1909, the Municipality presented the first Dux Prizes.
    
    In 1910, Mr. L. J. Grant became the Headmaster, and six new classrooms were constructed to accommodate 300 boys. The school welcomed its first boarders, housed at "Brownings" on North Avenue. During this time, the school introduced its first colors and adopted the motto "Tantum Facienda Parum Factum."
    
    In 1911, the school launched its first School Magazine, publishing it twice per annum.
    
    From 1914 to 1918, during the Great War, Prince Edward School pupils served with distinction. Fifteen pupils, as well as the former Headmaster from 1903 to 1910, Mr. D. Blue, were honored on the Roll of Honour.
    
    In 1917, Mr. A. J. Somerville assumed the role of Headmaster.
    
    With the return of peace and normality in 1918, the school resumed its regular activities.
    
    In 1920, inter-house activities were introduced, and four houses named Jameson, Rhodes, Selous, and Wilson were established, each with its Latin motto.
    
    By 1921, the school registered 350 pupils.
    
    In 1922, the Old Hararians Association was formed, marking an important milestone. The school's enrollment also reached 384 pupils.

    In 1941, Mr. A. J. Somerville retired as Headmaster after 24 years of dedicated service. He was succeeded by Mr. H. G. Livingston.
    
    In 1942, a fund was established to construct an Undenominational Memorial Chapel.
    
    In 1947, Mr. H. H. Cole assumed the role of Headmaster, and the school motto was changed to "Tot Facienda Parum Factum."
    
    In 1951, the foundation stone for the memorial chapel was laid by Sir Godfrey Huggins.
    
    In 1952, Mr. J. A. Slaven was appointed as the new Headmaster.
    
    In 1953, the completed chapel was dedicated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev Dr. F. R. Paget, along wth the Rev J. Kennedy Grant and the Rev H. Carter.</p>

        <p class="para-text">Too many hundreds nay, thousands of Old Hararians throughout the world, the memory of their younger days especially
          school days, which was the bulk of their younger lives lingers ever in their memories, and reminiscences.
          
          Prince Edward School induces that line of thought, for school was their life, their being and their all.
          
          In fact in the words of the poets and intellectuals, school is a never forgotten factor, something to live for, to
          strive for and sometimes with their country to die for.</p>
